Project Description: Predictive Modeling for Travel Insurance Purchase

As part of a comprehensive data science project, I developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a customer purchasing travel insurance. This project involved leveraging real-time data obtained through an API, applying advanced data preprocessing techniques, and employing machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

    I retrieved data from an API source that provided relevant customer information such as demographics, travel history, and past purchase behavior.
    Conducted data preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for modeling. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure optimal performance of the machine learning models.

Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:

    Employed a rigorous approach to model selection by comparing several machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
    Utilized Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) to tune hyperparameters for each algorithm, optimizing their performance on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation and Deployment:

    Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics and identified Random Forest as the best-performing algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 84% on unseen data.
    Developed a user-friendly web application to deploy the predictive model using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive dashboards.
    Deployed the application on the Streamlit community cloud and rendered it for public access, allowing users to input their details and instantly receive predictions on their likelihood to purchase travel insurance.

Key Skills and Technologies Used:

    Python for data preprocessing, modeling, and application development.
    Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
    Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
    Streamlit for building and deploying the web application.
    Grid Search Cross-Validation for optimizing model performance.
    API integration for real-time data acquisition.

This project not only showcased my proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques but also highlighted my ability to translate predictive models into practical applications for end-users. The experience gained from this project significantly enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and deployment of machine learning solutions in a production environment.
